# Career Clusters: Grouping Job Advertisements with Unsupervised Learning

## Project Description
This project explores a data-driven approach to clustering LinkedIn job postings based on key skills and description terms. The model is designed to recommend similar job postings to enhance users' search experience and expand the scope of relevant opportunities beyond their initial search query.
